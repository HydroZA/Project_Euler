# Problem 6

#The sum of the sum_of_the_squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

#The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

#Hence the difference between the sum of the sum_of_the_squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

#Find the difference between the sum of the sum_of_the_squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of
